    <body>Why is belly fat harmful to your health?

          Fat tissues consist of fat cells. They are special in their own ways. Fat cells produce a hormone called cortisone. Cortisone is a stress hormone, which means that it will put your body in stress mode, which is to increase your heartbeat, hence increase your blood pressure. When you get scared of a noise you hear in your apartment, your heartbeat goes up, this is due to the production of stress hormones as well as a role played by your sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nervous system helps with quick responses, mostly providing a flight situation; refering to the fight or flight term.
